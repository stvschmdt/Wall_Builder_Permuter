Wall Builder
Program returns the count of number of ways to construct a wall using 2ft and 3ft bricks with no running cracks.
Default input is 9x3 but argv1 and argv2 can be entered for other variations.

***********
* Running *
***********

$ make
$ ./wall 9 3

//output
8

*********

The program can be tested for correctness on permutations of width/height up to a range of about 22 10.

* Thought Process *
*******************

Quick Overview of problem solving process:

1. Find linear combinations of 2*x + 3*y = width
2. Represent each linear combination in binary (unique to size)
3. For each combination, find all unique permutations of the binary representation
4. Dynamic Programming - build a 2D matrix (symmetric, but created full verse upper diagonal) to perform counting recursively
5. 2D matrix would contain 0 if not compatible with M(i,j) below, 1 if it was
6. Spawn recursive calls to table to return +1 at last level of bricks providing a cumulative sum
7. Spend some time cleaning up unused arrays, commenting, makefile, etc
